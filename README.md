On this occasion, I got acquainted with the REST API which I will use to carry out the web scraping process in more depth. Python's clear and simple programming language makes it an ideal programming language and allows for interacting with REST APIs, in the Python programming language, there is one library created specifically to provide that functionality: Requests. Requests in the Python programming language is a feature that provides Python with the simple elegance of making HTTP requests to any API in the world.

Then what is the role of HTTP, API, and REST?

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a web service that provides access to certain data and methods that other applications can access, and sometimes edit â€“ via the standard HTTP protocol, just like a website. This simplicity makes it easy to quickly integrate the API into a wide variety of applications. REpresentational State Transfer (REST), is the most popular architectural style of API for web services. It consists of a set of guidelines designed to simplify client/server communication. The REST API makes data access much easier and logical.
A popular web architectural style called REST (or representational state transfer) allows users to interact with web services via GET and POST calls (the two most commonly used) which we briefly looked at in the previous section. For example, the Website REST API allows developers to access core Website data and the Search API provides a method for developers to interact with the data.

Then, on this occasion I did a web scraping process with the API method on one of the apartment rental websites,flokq.com, there are many data features that I can retrieve from flokq.com using the API method.
